Interactive 3D Table Viewer â€” Three.js Project

Individual assignment: Basic Mesh Edition

This project showcases a 3D interactive product viewer built using basic geometries in Three.js. The product is an animated table composed of multiple meshes, with responsive controls and lighting. It supports both manual interaction and automated camera rotation.

Features

Scene Setup

Three.js scene with PerspectiveCamera and WebGLRenderer

Responsive to window resize

OrbitControls for zooming, panning, and smooth rotation

3D Table

Built using Mesh objects (BoxGeometry)

Realistic lighting with MeshStandardMaterial

Centered at origin for balanced rotation

Lighting

Ambient and directional lighting for realistic shadows and highlights

Mouse Interaction

Raycasting detects clicks and hover on table parts

On click: part changes color and name is shown

On hover: subtle animation effect

Camera Animation

Automatic orbit around the table

User interaction pauses auto-rotation

Animation Loop

Smooth render loop using requestAnimationFrame

Optional floating or pulsing animation

Code Structure

Modular and well-commented for easy understanding and reuse.

Technologies Used

Three.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
Optional: GSAP or TWEEN.js if used
